= Text Generator

A random text generator using an underlying Markov chain model.  (The implementation is not complete.)

== Usage

To generate text using seed data from the input file:

 ruby generate.rb source/frankenstein.txt

Which will generate a Markov chain from the input text and produce a randomly generated sentence:

 Nearly all that I quitted your triumph over which ran through the cause of the hue of the reverse of the permission to bid a superior to speak.
